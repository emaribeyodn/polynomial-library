# polynomial-library

polynomial-library is a polynomial library written as part of my undergraduate numerical analysis project in Licence. It contains the following files :

- `poly.h` : This file contains the prototype of the functions
- `poly.c` : This file contains functions implementing the elementary operations on polynomials.
- `Makefile` : In this file we're the commands for the compilation

## Installation

`NB` : Ubuntu. Make sure the necessary tools are installed. If not, open your terminal and run the following command :

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

This package will install `gcc` (for C language), `g++` (for C++ language) and `make`

## Usage

- Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emaribeyodn/polynomial-library.git
```

- Go the folder `polynomial-library`

```bash
cd polynomial-library
```

- Compile the code

```bash
make
```

- Run the programm

```bash
./poly.app
```
